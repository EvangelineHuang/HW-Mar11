    <h1>Visualization with animation and interaction and how to achieve it in d3</h1>
    <p><a href="https://qz.com/296941/interactive-graphic-every-active-satellite-orbiting-earth/">Click here for the visualization</a></p>
    <p>This visualization is composed of different sizes of circles, squares and grid lines. If I want to create this
      visulizaiton using d3 and svg, first I will creat a svg with groups of shapes. Then I will create different
    div elements and hide them and set their positions to absolute. Then give each circle or square an event listener. When they are
  hovered over, move the their corresponding div element to the right place and show their labels, when the mouse moves out, hide the div again.
 The shapes also need another event listener for click event. When the shapes are clicked, their opacity attributes are changed and
they are given different colors of strokes for emphasis.</p>
<p>One thing I do not like this visualization is that when there are too many circles, the graph looks messy because all of the circles
are overlapping with each other, which makes them really hard to choose, even though they are transparent. </p>
